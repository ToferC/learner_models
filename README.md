# Prototype for Learner Data Models for CSPS Digital Academy

Exploring the data needs for learners and the CSPS.

## Context

* The CSPS is at an inflection point in our data practices and strategy.
* COVID-19, a move to virtual delivery and a new Learning Management System necessitate new ways of developing, delivering and reporting on learning.
* Today is the best time to evaluate and re-work our data systems that we will have for years to come.

## Opportunity

* By using modern data tools and a business-driven data schema, the CSPS can better manage our business and create value across the GC.

## Principles: privacy, security and inclusivity

* This is an MVP data architecture for learning. It is designed for discussion and iterative development. Nothing is sacred.
* It proposes a first cut of what data the CSPS requires to meet its organizational and broader GC responsibilities.
* All data will be protected appropriately and respect both privacy and security of organizations and individuals.
* Where possible, data will not be collected, but pulled from a trusted source.
* Demographic data should be voluntary, but an inclusive lens is required to identify bias in our organizations and systems.
